# Challenge One Horiseon Code Refactor
This is a code refactoring project for my coding bootcamp where the goal was to update the faux website's accesbility wihtin theh HTML file, while also restructuring and reorganizing HTML and CSS elements.

## Updated Accesibility 
    
    - Navigation bar was not properly linked to anchor tags.  To fix this, navigation buttons were properly placed within a <nav> containers and linked to appropriately to navigate users to linked sections.
    - Alternitve descriptors were added to photos for the hero, services and benefits section. 

## HTML and CSS Refactoring

    -Restructered the navgigation bar into container and linked buttons to services section in main body.

    -Reorganized Services Section by changing multiple <div> containters into <section> containers. 
        -Reasigned children to have appropriate indicators to sync with with stylesheet.

    -Placed Benefits Section into <aside> container and reassigned children elements to have appropriate indicators with stylesheet.
    
    -Consolidated CSS indicators to work for multple HTML elements to give stylsheet cleaner organization.
